vagrant file

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
Currently, there are only two supported versions: "1" and "2". Version 1 represents the configuration from Vagrant 1.0.x. "2" represents the configuration for 1.1+ leading up to 2.0.x

vagrant hostmanager
all active machines with the same provider will have their hosts file updated accordingly. Set the hostmanager.enabled attribute to true in the Vagrantfile to activate this behavior.
	config.hostmanager.enabled = true 
	config.hostmanager.manage_host = true

vm.define
Vagrant allows us to define more virtual machines by wrapping them in blocks like the following:
	config.vm.define "db01" do |db01|
	syntax- config.vm.define "<vmName>" do |<vmName>|
  				<snip>
			end

	Note:You absolutely need to make sure you give them a unique hostname, IP address, and name setting so there arenâ€™t conflicts.

vagrant box
This is the command used to manage (add, remove, etc.) boxes.
	add, list, outdated, prune, remove, repackage ,update
	mc01.vm.box = "geerlingguy/centos7" 
	syntax - <vmName>.vm.box = "imagename"

mc01.vm.hostname = "mc01"
name of vm

guest = a m/c that  going to be spin up which port that will be 
	port forwarding=
		guest_listening on = port, host ("how we get to that port from our host m/c which we are a that movement")

		  e.g. guest = 80, host = 8089 
		  (nginx listen on port 80)
		  (on host which are services are running)

	port private_network=
		 syntax = "private_network", type: "dhcp"
		 note: dhcp will give ip address to spining vm's

		 syntax = "private_network", ip: "192.168.1.1"
		 note: unique local area ip
